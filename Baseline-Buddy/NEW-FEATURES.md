## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Autocomplete
const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState<string[]>([])
const [showSuggestions, setShowSuggestions] = useState(false)

// Recent searches
const [recentSearches, setRecentSearches] = useState<string[]>([])

// Copy functionality
const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false)

// Comparison mode
const [comparisonMode, setComparisonMode] = useState(false)
const [comparisonResults, setComparisonResults] = useState<FeatureResult[]>([])
```

### localStorage Integration
```typescript
// Load on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('recentSearches')
  if (stored) {
    setRecentSearches(JSON.parse(stored))
  }
}, [])

// Save on search
const saveToRecentSearches = (searchTerm: string) => {
  const updated = [searchTerm, ...recentSearches.filter(s => s !== searchTerm)].slice(0, 5)
  setRecentSearches(updated)
  localStorage.setItem('recentSearches', JSON.stringify(updated))
}
```

### Clipboard API
```typescript
const copyToClipboard = () => {
  if (!result) return
  const text = `Feature: ${result.feature}
Baseline Safe: ${result.baselineSafe ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
Browsers: ${result.browsers.join(', ')}
Explanation: ${result.aiExplanation}`
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)
  setCopied(true)
  setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000)
}
```

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### Standard Search Flow
1. User starts typing → Autocomplete suggestions appear
2. User clicks suggestion or continues typing
3. User presses Enter or clicks "Check Feature"
4. Results display with copy button
5. Search is saved to recent searches

### Comparison Mode Flow
1. User clicks "Compare Features" button
2. Comparison mode activates (button turns blue)
3. User searches for first feature → Added to comparison
4. User searches for more features → All added to table
5. User views side-by-side comparison
6. User can:
   - Copy entire comparison
   - Remove individual features
   - Clear all and start over
   - Exit comparison mode

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- Debounced autocomplete (prevents excessive filtering)
- LocalStorage caching (instant recent searches)
- Conditional rendering (comparison view only when needed)
- Efficient state updates (minimal re-renders)
- CSS animations (GPU-accelerated)

## 🎯 Future Enhancement Ideas

- Export comparison as PDF/CSV
- Feature favorites/bookmarks
- Search history with timestamps

- Share comparison via URL
- Comparison presets (e.g., "CSS Grid vs Flexbox")
