## 🎨 My Recommendation

For a **hackathon-winning look**, I recommend:

1. **Keep Current Grid** (clean and professional) ✅
2. **Add Gradient Orbs** (2 large, slow-moving blurred circles) 
3. **Add Noise Texture** (film grain for depth)

This combo is:
- ✅ Trendy (gradient orbs are hot right now)
- ✅ Professional (grid + noise = premium feel)  
- ✅ Subtle (won't distract from your features)
- ✅ Fast to implement (5 minutes)

**Want me to implement these 3 together?** Just say "add gradient orbs and noise" and I'll do it!
