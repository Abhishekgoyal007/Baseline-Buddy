## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Counters not animating?**
- Make sure you OPEN the stats dashboard (not just refresh)
- Counters trigger on dashboard open

### **Staggered cards all appear at once?**
- Check if CSS animation is being blocked
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **Buttons don't press?**
- Check if `btn-press` class is on buttons
- Animation is very quick (0.1s) - look carefully!

### **Input doesn't glow?**
- Make sure you actually CLICK inside input
- Glow is subtle blue ring around input

### **Scroll reveal not working?**
- Scroll slowly to see effect
- Only triggers once per card
- Refresh page to see again

### **Spinner not showing?**
- Loading happens quickly - search might complete fast
- Try searching complex feature or if backend is slow

### **Checkmark doesn't draw?**
- Only animates for BASELINE SAFE features
- Try: "fetch", "flexbox", "grid", "async-await"
- Red X for unsafe features has no animation (by design)

---

## 💡 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **Good Animation Should:**
✅ Be smooth (no jank or stuttering)
✅ Have purpose (guides user attention)
✅ Be fast (0.1-0.6s typically)
✅ Not distract from content
✅ Work on first try (no bugs)

### **Bad Animation Would Be:**
❌ Laggy or choppy
❌ Too slow (annoying)
❌ Doesn't trigger properly
❌ Distracting or overwhelming
❌ Breaks on certain actions
